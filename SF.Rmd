Here in the plot, I wanted to use a ggplot in order to see the diffrence between both pitchers but it is 
hard to tell since there is an overlap. I wanted to see the rel_speed and in this case the spin rate
where there is a correlation.


```{R}
ggplot(data = SF, aes(x = rel_speed, y = spin_rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = pitcher_id), size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, col = "black") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 3000)) +
  labs(title = "MLB Players", subtitle = "SF",
       x = "REL speed", y = "spin_rate", caption = "for 2022")



```

```{R}
 hchart(
   SF,
 "scatter",
  hcaes(x = distance, y = bearing, group = pitcher_id)
 )
```
